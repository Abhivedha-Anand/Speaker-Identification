Speaker Identification utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)

In a Speaker Identification mini project utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), we developed a system capable of recognizing speakers from audio samples. By extracting relevant features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), I trained GMMs to model the acoustic characteristics of each speaker's voice. During testing, the system accurately predicted the speaker of a given audio sample by comparing its features with the trained GMMs.
